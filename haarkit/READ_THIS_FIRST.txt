Methods to create a cascade

A positive image should be a grayscale .bmp file cropped to only have the desired object to be detected.
A negative image should be and image that is of where you will find the object to be detected but without the actual object.

Recommend a  2:1 ratio pos/neg

Place each type in it's respective folder. i.e. positve/ negative/

In the negative folder run create_list.sh to generate a list of the negative images.

If needed, adjust create_samples.sh to fit your needs. Then run create_samples.sh
	If you use create_samples on a single image and create multiple .vec files, 
	run createVecList.sh and then use opencv_mergevec in /data to merge them all together.

If needed, adjust traincascade.sh to fit your needs. Then run traincascade.sh

The final cascade will be in data/cascade.xml
