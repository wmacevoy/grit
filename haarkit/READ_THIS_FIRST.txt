Methods to create a cascade

A positive image should be a grayscale .bmp file cropped to only have the desired object to be detected.
A negative image should be and image that is of where you will find the object to be detected but without the actual object.

Place each type in it's respective folder. i.e. positve/ negative/

In the negative folder run create_list.sh to generate a list of the negative images.

If needed, adjust create_samples.sh to fit your needs. Then run create_samples.sh

If needed, adjust traincascade.sh to fit your needs. Then run traincascade.sh

The final cascade will be in data/cascade.xml
